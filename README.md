# Description

This repository contains my submissions to Rivigo's Coding Championship which was a week long contest to make approximate algorithms to a complex problem. We finished as runners up solving problem using Monte-Carlo simulations with heuristics. 

The questions and solutions can be found on their official blog [here](https://eng.rivigo.com/technology/rivigo-coding-championship-indias-top-coders-quest-to-solve-the-impossible/).
